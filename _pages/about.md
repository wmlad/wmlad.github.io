The Washington Merged Longitudinal Administrative Data (WMLAD) is a novel data resource comprising longitudinal and geocoded administrative records from Washington state. WMLAD was built out of a collaboration between researchers at the University of Washington and the Washington Department of Social and Health Services, Research and Data Analysis division. Records from seven Washington state agencies are linked using a single unique person identifier, allowing researchers to merge information from different sources and follow individuals across time and space. The datasets included in WMLAD touch on important economic and social indicators, with rich information on employment, social services, residential location and mobility, and demographic characteristics. Together, these records contain information on over 10 million individuals, representing a near-census of Washingtonâ€™s adult residents between 2010 and 2016 (with some records covering other years).
