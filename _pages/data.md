Source Data

WMLAD draws administrative records from seven state agencies:

| State Agency | Record type | Key information | Time period | Number of individuals |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Employment Security Department | Employment records for Unemployment Insurance-eligible jobs | Earnings, hours worked, job characteristics, Unemployment Insurance receipt | 2000-2017 | 7,699,646 workers |
|  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |

While there is substantial overlap between the populations covered by each data source, the component datasets of WMLAD represent distinct populations based on the administrative processes that lead individuals to be represented in each set of records. Table X represents the overlap between key WMLAD populations. Each column represents a key data source, and each row indicates what share of individuals in that data source are also included in another source.
