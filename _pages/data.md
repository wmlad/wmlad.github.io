While there is substantial overlap between the populations covered by each data source, the component datasets of WMLAD represent distinct populations based on the administrative processes that lead individuals to be represented in each set of records. Table X represents the overlap between key WMLAD populations. Each column represents a key data source, and each row indicates what share of individuals in that data source are also included in another source.
